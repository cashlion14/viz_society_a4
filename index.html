    <h2>Proposition: America has done a good job fighting climate change.</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure style="position: relative; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; overflow: auto">

					Here we see how America is using less and less C02 as it grows. The economy is still expanding rapidly, but for every dollar we add to our nation, we use less and less C02. This is why growth oriented actions such as those noted in the graph are so important in our continued fight against climate change.

				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Use of CO2 Emissions (kg per $ of GDP): I would give myself a score of -1 for this design choice. I wanted to use a metric that showed a clear negative correlation between amount of CO2 and time. While we are decreasing in CO2 use per capita over time, GDP makes the decrease more pronounced because it typically increases faster than our population grows. I think under careful study a viewer would wonder why I chose to compare it to GDP, but in general the first thing you see is this strong negative correlation which boosted my point. </li>
				<li>Use of annotations: I would give myself a -2 for this design choice. I purposefully only included notable events that I felt would make clear the progress that America was making towards a clean energy future. This is especially notable given that one of my events (2009) was never actually signed into law.</li>
				<li>Arrow usage: I would give this choice a 0 because I think it emphasized a very clear trend, but it was a trend that was somewhat deceptive. I got this idea from our second reading group paper, where the New York Times made two similar charts, each using the same data to display a different message. The arrow accentuates the trend and leads into the fact that the US now uses ~20% renewable energy.</li>
				<li>Color Choice: I would give this a 1. I think it was an earnest choice to accentuate how the use of C02 was changing, and very clearly related CO2 use to temperature. In doing so I made the chart nicer to look at and more topical.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure style="position: relative; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; align-items: center; overflow: auto">
				<img src="Sheet 5.png" alt="" style="flex-shrink: 0; max-width: 100%;"/>
				<figcaption>
					When compared to other large developed and developing nations, the United States uses 2-3x more C02 per person on average every single year. People like to argue that China and India are contributing to the modern climate crisis more than we are, and on a net scale that’s true, but individually we are greater polluters. Each one of us is using more than our fair share— we need to do more to reduce it and save our planet.

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Use of C02 Emissions per Capita: I would give this a +2. I think this was probably the most earnest decision that I made during the entire process. C02 per capita is probably the best method I can think of for direct comparison between nations. There are some challenges, especially at small scales (see my next bullet) but using a per capita metric places everything here in scale. </li>
				<li>Use of specific countries: this is a -1 decision for me. Some nations, especially smaller ones, had much higher GDP/capita than the US. But I felt that the United States needed to be the highest on the chart to effectively convey my message, so I put a population floor of 100 million on the chart. Beyond that, I removed countries to make the graph more easily readable.</li>
				<li>Use of a bar chart: +1 on this one. The bar chart is an effective way to get my message across, because it shows relative scale among different nations in the most important category for me. It makes very clear that the US has the highest C02/capita by a good bit, and compares it to many of the other largest nations in the world (plus the EU).</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>This task was much harder than I initially thought it would be! And yet, I very much enjoyed it. One of the aspects that made the project pleasant for me was the quality of the HDI data from The World Bank. It was very easy to use the data, and there were relatively few null values to work with. However, the more difficult part was figuring out what proposition to put forth. As I explored the data, I often found evidence to support a certain proposition very clearly, but finding a way to emphasize the other side was much more difficult. One example of this actually came after the EDA phase, as I was creating my final visualizations. For my proposition in support of the statement, “America has done a good job fighting climate change”, I was working on what would become my final product, a look at C02 emissions from America over the last 20 years, annotated with notable events related to climate. As I prepared to start my next visualization, I was at a loss for what metric to use, since I didn’t want to use C02/capita twice. I looked at some of the other metrics, which had clear negative linear relationships between emission and time, which wouldn’t work when I wanted to tell people that we were doing a bad job. As a result, I took one of the clear negative relationships (C02 emissions/$ of GDP) and replaced C02/capita in my first image. I then used C02/capita in my second image!</p>
	  <p>While I was struck by some of those methodological challenges throughout my experience, what became most important was the ways that my thinking about deception changed. The line between deception and earnestness is blurry and depends on how much evidence you leave behind. For instance, if the broad trend picked up at the first glance is misleading, but you clearly mark on the chart (with a line break, footnote, or other annotation) how it might be misleading, are you being deceiving? In the case in which one leaves no trace, that would certainly be misleading. But is it the designer’s fault if readers do not take the time to understand what their visualization says? I think this is related to something I’ve been discussing in my literature class this semester. Works of communication (visualizations, speeches, novels, etc) are meant to be shared with an audience. This is especially true of visualizations, which are meant to be consumed by other people, unlike say, some forms of art. However, the use of social media, the internet, and varied forms of communication means that content is disseminated widely and to unintended audiences. The visualization designer should take reasonable precautions to make their visualization representative of the underlying data on the first glance, closer look, and detailed examination, because they do not know what method of observation will be used when the visualization is conveyed in some future medium. Should they do that satisfactorily, I would hazard to say that they have ethically analyzed a dataset.</p>
